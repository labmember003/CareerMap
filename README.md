# CareerMap
The career guidance app aims to address two key challenges: firstly, the lack of awareness about various professions beyond traditional fields like medicine and engineering, and secondly, the difficulty individuals face in identifying their passions and interests. By employing deep data analysis and user responses to a diverse set of questions covering skills, preferences, and work styles, the app guides users toward undiscovered professions. Additionally, the platform facilitates direct connections between users and professionals in their chosen fields, offering mentorship opportunities. The app generates revenue by charging users for platform access while compensating professionals for their services, making it a valuable intermediary in career exploration and mentorship.
